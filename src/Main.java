/*Every java program must have a class and a main method
* The main method executes tasks of the program
* Java comments are usually ignored by the compiler.
* They add important context for the human reader to understand the code
* Java is a compiled language. The compiler catches errors and mistakes in our code
* Compilers then transform the code into an executable class*/
